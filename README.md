# About Abby

This is a story by Andrea Cole about a blind girl named Abby who stumbles across an underground world.

A girl named Abby who was blind from birth has always wanted to explore the city. She was given a smart phone so that she can listen to everything she couldn't see. Because she had a smart phone she was able to use speech recognition as her eyes every day. One day, she wanted to see (no pun) and experience the city.Â  She calls to her phone "Hey Siri, take me downtown." Because Siri thought see said, take me underground, she began to walk outside and following the directions of her phone and she ended up at a underground tunnel that looked like a garden of the galaxies? Instead of feeling a cool breeze and warm chatter of people alike she hears sounds of animals. Because she was now underground, she no longer has an Internet connection. She yells, "Hey Siri, where am I?" She notices there is no response. She is now afraid because she doesn't know where she is and what's going on. She begins to cry.
