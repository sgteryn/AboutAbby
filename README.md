# About Abby

This is a story by Andrea Cole about a blind girl named Abby who stumbles across 
an underground world.

> A girl named Abby who was blind from birth has always wanted to explore the 
city. She was given a smart phone so that she can listen to everything she 
couldn't see.

> Because she had a smart phone she was able to use speech recognition as her 
eyes every day.

> One day, she wanted to see (no pun) and experience the city. She calls to her 
phone "Hey Siri, take me downtown."

> Because Siri thought Abby said "take me underground," Abby began to walk 
outside and following the directions of her phone and she ended up at an 
underground tunnel that looked like a garden of the galaxies?

> Instead of feeling a cool breeze and warm chatter of people alike she hears 
sounds of animals.

> Because she is now underground, she no longer has an Internet connection. She 
yells, "Hey Siri, where am I?" She notices there is no response. She is now 
afraid because she doesn't know where she is and what's going on. She begins to 
cry.

We haven't yet decided on the ending, nor how to split it into chapters.

**UPDATE**, November 14, 2023: We are moving this to 
[a SwiftUI project](https://github.com/Leroywhitt/WheresAbbySwiftUIStory).
